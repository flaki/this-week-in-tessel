# This Week in Tessel: the busy summer issue!

Hello, Tesselators!

**TL;DR:**

* We want your feedback on an upcoming Tessel project -> [Take this 6-question **survey**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScBWewWewrpcfLEw7ogQB9MB3e79kAZdcOwg2FQTci1XGBOTg/viewform)
* [**Tesselcamp**](https://github.com/tessel/project/issues/179) is coming up this week in NYC; please join the [community day](http://www.meetup.com/nodebots/events/233568320/) if you're in the area!
* [International **Nodebots Day**](http://nodebots.io/#nodebots-day) was a grand success with the [Johnny-Five Inventor's Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/1384://www.sparkfun.com/products/13847)!

## Tessel Community Survey

We're researching the next direction for Tessel Project hardware, and we have six questions for you.

Help us out by telling us what the future of connected things should look like on [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScBWewWewrpcfLEw7ogQB9MB3e79kAZdcOwg2FQTci1XGBOTg/viewform)!

## Tesselcamp

The Tessel Team (the Steering Committee and some of the Team Members) are meeting in person the first time at [Tesselcamp](https://github.com/tessel/project/issues/179) next week.

The event will be a low-key three-day session in New York City for core community members to discuss vision, focus on key issues, and spend time together as a team.

The final day of Tesselcamp (**Saturday, September 3**) is a **community day**, in which members of the public are welcomed to use the hardware and expertise of the core Project members and get up to speed contributing to the Project. If you're in the area, [please come](http://www.meetup.com/nodebots/events/233568320/)!

For those not in the area, we encourage you to spin your own "welcome to open source" themed events. Want to host one in your local community? Get in touch; we would be happy to help.

## Nodebots Day Recap

We mentioned [International Nodebots Day](http://nodebots.io/#nodebots-day) in the last newsletter, with a special mention of the [Johnny-Five Inventor's Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/1384://www.sparkfun.com/products/13847) as the kit of choice for a few of the event locations, like [NYC](https://twitter.com/nodebots_nyc/status/759420544127303681) and [Miami](https://twitter.com/MiamiJS/status/75944265966031257://twitter.com/MiamiJS/status/759442659660312576). The Tessel 2 was also used to power Sumobots at Houston's event, with a [great recap](http://justingosses.com/nodebots/) by Justin Gosses.
